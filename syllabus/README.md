## Academic Integrity

Students are absolutely encouraged to leverage learning resources outside of official course materials to enhance understanding and complete assignments. This includes use of tools like forums, search engines, or Large Language Models (LLM) such as Open AI ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and GitHub Copilot for example.

Generally speaking and unless otherwise stated by the instructor, students are also allowed to work together to collaboratively problem solve and come up with solutions.

That said, all students must credit provide credit for anything they did not generate themselves. This includes code, documentation, quotes, multimedia items used for presentations, and etc.

Any use of materials without providing proper credit will be considered cheating and will result in disciplinary action.
